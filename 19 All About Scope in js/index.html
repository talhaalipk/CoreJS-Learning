    Scope in JavaScript

Scope refers to the accessibility (visibility) of variables, functions, and other identifiers within your code. It determines where in your program you can use a particular identifier. Understanding scope is crucial for writing well-structured, maintainable, and bug-free JavaScript code.

Types of Scope in JavaScript:

JavaScript primarily uses function scope and block scope (introduced in ES6). There are also concepts of global scope and lexical scope that are related to function scope.

Function Scope:

Variables declared within a function are only accessible from within that function.
This is the default scope for variables declared with var, let, and const inside functions.
Example:
JavaScript
function greet(name) {
    let message = "Hello, " + name + "!"; // `message` is local to `greet`
    console.log(message);
}

greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!

// console.log(message); // Error: message is not defined
Use code with caution.
Block Scope (ES6):

Variables declared with let and const within curly braces {} (blocks) are only accessible from within those blocks.
This provides more granular control over variable visibility compared to function scope.
Example:
JavaScript
if (true) {
    let x = 10;
}

console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined (outside the block)
Use code with caution.
Global Scope:

Variables declared outside of any function are considered to have global scope.
They are accessible from anywhere in your program, which can lead to naming conflicts and unintended side effects. It's generally recommended to avoid using global variables excessively.
Example:
JavaScript
let globalVar = "This is global";

function myFunction() {
    console.log(globalVar);
}

myFunction(); // Output: This is global
Use code with caution.
Script Scope (Historical):

In older JavaScript environments, variables declared at the top level of a script file had script scope.
However, with modern browsers using strict mode (which is the default now), script scope is effectively the same as global scope.
Lexical Scope:

A broader term encompassing function scope and block scope.
Refers to how code nesting determines variable visibility. Variables are looked up in nested scopes, starting from the current block and moving outward to enclosing functions.
Example:
JavaScript
function outer() {
    let outerVar = "outer";

    function inner() {
        let innerVar = "inner";
        console.log(outerVar); // Can access outerVar because of lexical scope
        console.log(innerVar);
    }

    inner();
}

outer();
Use code with caution.
Choosing the Right Scope:

Prefer let and const for variable declarations to take advantage of block scope.
Use global variables sparingly and only when truly necessary.
Understanding scope helps you write code that is more predictable and less prone to errors.
